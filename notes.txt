-react works on virtual dom
-it doesnot directly inject code in dom
- there are basically 2 virtual doms, it compares them and find out their difference
- the above process is called diffing
- then the changes are applied in dom, so it is faster than traditional js
- and the above process is called reconcilation
- component means a thing that has its own UI and logic - eg- register buttn
- we use props to make component dynamic - eg- making login btn from above register btn
